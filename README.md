# Parler For Wordpress
Parler For Wordpress is a plugin which enables people to add comments to Wordpress articles.
These comments become integrated into the Parler.

Getting Started

The actual Parler comment components are written using React. Currently, these components are
in a separate project. If you want to modify this project, you'll need to have React and npm installed
as well as an understanding of the information in the HOW_TO_ADD_REACT.md file in this project.
