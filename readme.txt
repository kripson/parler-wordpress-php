Parler : /paʁ.le/ : /par-lay/ is a Commenting, Social News, and Influence Network. Replace WordPress comments with Parler!

== Description ==
Parler : /paʁ.le/ : /par-lay/ is a Commenting, Social News, and Influence Network that creates a shared ecosystem between digital publishers, influencers and users. Rather than a static website commenting plugin, Parler utilizes a mobile client front-end to engage users directly within the social network. The application enables users to publish original content and provides for the easy discovery of true-trending comments, posts and news. Direct push notifications allow users to rejoin threads and keep conversation active. In addition to these features, Parler offers self-moderation tools in order to curate a very personal user experience.
